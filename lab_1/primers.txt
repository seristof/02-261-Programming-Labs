Universal [forward] primer: CAAATATCATTCTGAGGAGC
Length 20, matches starting at base 408 to beef and pork and at base 411 to chicken.

Chicken primer: AGTAATACCTGCGATTGCAAA
Original genome that it attaches to: TTTGCAATCGCAGGTATTACT
Length 21, matches chicken genome starting at base 561 as a reverse complement.

Beef primer: ATGCAAATAGGAAGTACCACT
Original genome that it attaches to: AGTGGTACTTCCTATTTGCAT
Length 21, matches beef genome starting at base 811 as a reverse complement.

Pork primer: AATAGGCATTGACTTAGTGGT
Original genome that it attaches to: ACCACTAAGTCAATGCCTATT
Length 21, matches pork genome starting at base 953 as a reverse complement.

The expected lengths of the copied segments for each type of DNA are:
Chicken - 171
Beef - 424
Pork - 566
